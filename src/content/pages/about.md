## Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer

![About Me Image](/About.png)

**Hi there!** I'm Dustin. I'm a committed to using technology to make a real difference. My career has been a journey of constant growthâ€”from my formative years in the Army, through the challenges of tech innovation at Gartner, to my current focus on the possibilities within data science, machine learning, and AI.

## Where I've Been

My career path is unique. In the Army, I took on roles that pushed me to my limits, sharpening my leadership skills and fostering a strong sense of duty in teaching and mentoring. These experiences built my capacity for analytical thinking and strategy.

Moving into the corporate sphere at Gartner, I was at the center of tech advancement and business strategy. Collaborating with executives and operational teams, I played a part in guiding organizations through the challenges of the COVID era with smart tech investments, observing the resilience and agility of companies navigating tough times.

## Where I Am

Now, as I move forward, my attention is fully on using data science, machine learning, and AI to impact areas like health, fitness, and psychology positively. I'm motivated by the potential of technology to drive significant, positive change and improve the well-being of people across the globe.

## Where I'm Going

My focus is clear:

I want to join a team that's as passionate as I am about making a real impact. I'm looking to bring not only my technical expertise but also my insights on leadership, resilience, and innovation to the table. My ambition is to create solutions that are technologically sophisticated and socially impactful.
